# Wizard's Castle, ncurses version

Complete and utter WIP.

This is intended to be an ncurses front end on the [Wizard's Castle
backend](https://github.com/beejjorgensen/Wizards-Castle-Rust) I wrote earlier.
(The backend also comes with a non-curses classic version of the game.)

## TODO

* Actions
  * Teleport

* Combat
  * Bribe
  * Spell

* Random messages

* Game over screen

* Colors on map

* Remove all discover_room_at_player

* `refresh()` instead of `wrefresh()` to cure some repaint ills?
