.SH DESCRIPTION

Wizard's Castle was written in the late 1970s by Joseph R. Power. It was
published in Recreational Computing Magazine in July 1980 for the Exidy
Sorceror, and was rapidly ported to a variety of different plaforms.

This is a recreation from the original sources, written in Rust.

.SS The Game

This adventure leads you through a random 8x8x8 dungeon full of creatures, gold,
treasure, and other things, good and bad.

The goal is to find and kill the monster that is carrying
.IR "The Runestaff" .

Once the Runestaff is obtained, the player can use it to teleport into the Warp
that contains the legendary
.IR "Orb of Zot" .
When the Orb of Zot is obtained, the Runestaff will disappear and the player
must make their way back out to the entrance and head north to exit the castle
to victory.

.SS Character generation

You can be an
.IR Hobbit ,
.IR Elf ,
.IR Human ,
or
.IR Dwarf .

Hobbits are the weakest and most nimble. Dwarves are the strongest and least
nimble. Elves and humans are in between.

You may choose male or female gender. This has no bearing on gameplay.

The next step is stat allocation. You have additional points to allocate among
your strength, intelligence, and dexterity. Hobbits get half as many allocation
points as the other races.

Armor ranges from
.IR plate ,
being the best, to
.IR leather ,
being the worst.

Weapons range from a
.IR sword ,
being the best, to a
.IR dagger ,
being the worst.

If you still have money remaining, you may buy a lamp.

Any gold pieces remaining at this point may be used to buy flares.

.SS The map

Symbols on the map describe what the room contains.

.TP
.B .
An empty room

.TP
.B E
The entrance. Go north from here to exit the castle. If you possess the Orb of
Zot when you exit, you win the game.

.TP
.B D
Stairs going down

.TP
.B U
Stairs going up

.TP
.B G
Gold pieces, free for the taking

.TP
.B P
A pool. When you drink from the pool, your stats change--for better or worse.
You might be surprised at what other changes you undergo.

.TP
.B C
A chest. There might be a pile of gold pieces inside. Or it could be trapped.

.TP
.B F
Flares. Use these to light the surrounding rooms.

.TP
.B W
A warp. This will teleport you randomly to another location in the dungeon.

One important exception is that one of the warps is the
.I Orb of Zot
in disguise. If you walk into this warp, you will simply appear on the other
side. Teleporting directly into this warp with the Runestaff will bring you into
possession of the Orb of Zot!

.TP
.B S
Sinkhole. You will drop into the level below. If you are in the deepest level,
you will drop to the top level!

.TP
.B O
A crystal Orb. If you gaze into this orb, you will see a varity of different
things. You might even see where the Orb of Zot is located--if the orb isn't
misleading you. If you see yourself in a bloody heap, your strength will suffer
and the orb will disintegrate.

Note that this is
.B not
the
.I "Orb of Zot" !

.TP
.B B
A book. Reading the book might help your stats. It might also make you blind, or
stick to your hands preventing you from fighting with your weapon.

.TP
.B M
A monster of some kind. One of these monsters carries the Runestaff, and must be
slain to acquire it.

When fighting monsters, you can attack with a weapon (if you have one), cast a
spell (if your intelligence is high enough), or bribe (if you have a treasure).

Be careful fighting Dragons and Gargoyles--your weapon might break!

.TP
.B V
A vendor. You can sell treasures to the vendor, buy weapons, armor, and lamps at
hugely-inflated prices, and purchase potions of gain stat.

You can attack vendors, but if you attack one, they
.B all
turn against you. You have to successfully bribe one to get back in their good
graces.

Defeating a vendor gives you all their wares.

.TP
.B T
A treasure. Some of the treasures have beneficial effects, while others are just
pretty.

.SS Changes from the original game

There was a bug in the original game that prevented curses from taking effect
unless the user was in the cursed room. This has been fixed.

Instead of explicitly retreating from monsters or ignoring vendors, the player
now just walks a cardinal direction for the same effect.

The following commands are new:

.in +4n
.BR [C] opyright

.BR [H] elp

.BR [I] nventory

.B [P] 
as a synonym for
.BR [T] eleport

.BR [R] ead
as a synonym for
.BR [O] "pening a book"
